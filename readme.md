this is a bot for spamming a lot of pings

put your token into keys.env

set the owner IDs and the role you want to ping (you can just set it to @everyone) within the top of main.py

this is api abuse, don't try making this too much faster, you will most likely get your IP banned for like 30 minutes or something idk

in order to setup the server, run the --startup command, this will take a minute or two

after this all channels that start with "spam" in their name will be relentlessly pinged :)
